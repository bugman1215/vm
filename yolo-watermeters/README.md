# Water Meter Detection


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
YoloV5 implemented by Pytorch , with support for training, evaluation and inference in a custom data set.


### Built With
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [opencv](https://opencv.org/)
* [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get a local copy just executed the following command:
Activate environment
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bugman1215/yolo-watermeters.git
```

### Prerequisites
Install all the requirements:
```sh
pip3 -m install -U -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The project was developed in three parts:
1. Preprocessing of images and data augmentation 
2. Modeling of the YoloV5 and implementation using water meter images 
3. Training of the network
4. Obtaining the water meter recognition of the testing images

The development of all the steps are consigned in the **main notebook**.
